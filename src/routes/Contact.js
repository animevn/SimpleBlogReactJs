        &emsp; 221B Baker Street is the London address of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes,
        created by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the United Kingdom, postal addresses
        with a number followed by a letter may indicate a separate address within a larger,
        often residential building. Baker Street in the late 19th century was a high-class
        residential district, and Holmes' apartment would probably have been part of a
        Georgian terrace.
        <br/>
        &emsp; At the time the Holmes stories were published, addresses in Baker Street did not
        go
        as high as 221. Baker Street was later extended, and in 1932 the Abbey National
        Building Society moved into premises at 219â€“229 Baker Street. For many years, Abbey
        National employed a full-time secretary to answer mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes.
        In 1990, a blue plaque signifying 221B Baker Street was installed at the Sherlock
        Holmes Museum, situated elsewhere on the same block, and there followed a 15-year
        dispute between Abbey National and the Holmes Museum for the right to receive mail
        addressed to 221B Baker Street. Since the closure of Abbey House in 2005, ownership
        of the address by the Holmes Museum has not been challenged, despite its location
        between 237 and 241 Baker Street.
